          </h3>
          <p className="ans_question1">
            React and React Native are developed by Facebook and have gained a
            huge fan base in a short time. React is known as ReactJs, which is a
            JavaScript library to build single-page web applications. Besides,
            React Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps.
            Moreover, with reusable components, you can develop native mobile
            applications. React is a JavaScript library of reusable components
            designed to create skeletons of the apps, whereas React Native is
            designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components. React
            is an open-source JS library for building the UIs for web
            applications; besides, React Native is used to build rich mobile UI
            from declarative components using only JavaScript. Both React and
            React Native are ruling the industry and are widely used for mobile
            and web applications. However, the difference between web apps vs
            websites will not affect your user..

            What is Context api
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange
            unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels
            of your application.Context provides a way to pass data
            through the component tree without having to pass props down
            manually at every level. For example, authenticated users, locale
            preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by
            many components. const Provider, Consumer=
            React.createContextdefaultValue

            Difference between callback and useCallback Hook ?

          <p>
            callback is like an argument passed to an function whereas another
            one is hook, in this you pass another function as an argument.

          </h3>
          <p>
            React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React
            and used to create r  outing in the React application using React
            Router Package.In this Browser Router as Router, Routes and Route
            and NavLink get imported from react-router-dom. React Router DOM
            enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the
            traditional routing ar  chitecture in which the routing is handled in
            a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM
            facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the
            app and platform.

            4. What is lazy loading in react ?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In essence, lazy loading means that a component or a part of code
            must get loaded when it is required. It is also referred to as code
            splitting and data fetching . Talking about React specifically, it
            bundles the complete code and deploys all of it at the same time.
            Example:An example of image lazy-loading can be found on the popular
            publishing platform Medium, which loads lightweight placeholder
            images at page load, and replaces them with lazily-loaded images as
            they're scrolled into the viewport. An example of image lazy-loading
            in action. Benefits: The benefits of lazy loading include: Reduces
            initial load time  Lazy loading a webpage reduces page weight,
            allowing for a quicker page load time. Bandwidth conservation  Lazy
            loading conserves bandwidth by delivering content to users only if
            it's requested.

            4. What does mean by state and its use in react?
          </h3>
          <p>
            State of a component is an object that holds some information that
            may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try
            to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of
            stateful components. Let's create a user component with message
            state,

            6. Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component.
          </h3>
          <h1>Stateless:</h1>
          <p>
            If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a
            stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for
            creating stateless components. But unless we need to use a lifecycle
            hook in your components, we should go for function components. There
            are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here;
            they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and
            you can avoid the this keyword altogether.
          </p>
          <h1 style={{ borderBottom: "1px solid gray" }}>Stateful:</h1>
          <p>
            If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the
            component then it can be termed as stateful component. These
            stateful components are always class components and have a state
            that gets initialized in the constructor. class App extends
           
          </p>
        
          <p>
            React 16.8 Update: Hooks let you use state and other React features
            without writing classes. The Equivalent Functional Component import
            React, from 'react';

            <li>Link</li>
            <li>NavLink</li>
            <li>Redirect Component</li>
            <li>history.push</li>
            <li>history.replace</li>
            <li>
              NavLink NavLink behaves the same as Link but in addition, it comes
              with a new attribute called ‚ÄúactiveClassName‚Äù which helps us to
              add the class to the anchor tag when page url will match.
            </li>
            <li>
              Link Link is used to manage the navigation and it worked as an
              anchor tag. Check below code for the demonstration. import 
              Link
              from 'react-router-dom'; ... ... About
