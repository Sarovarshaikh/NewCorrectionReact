          <h2>Axios :</h2>

          <p className="ans_question1">
            Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from
            node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the
            Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP
            requests and responses and enables client-side protection against
            XSRF. It also has the ability to cancel requests. EX::
            axios.get('url') .then((response) =&gt; {"{"} <br />
            ‚û°Ô∏è <br /> <br />
            // Code for handling the response <br />
            {"}"}) <br></br>
            .catch((error) ={">"} {"{"} <br />
            // Code for handling the error <br></br>
            {" }"})
          </p>
          <h2>Fetch:</h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The Fetch API provides a fetch() method defined on the window
            object. It also provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and
            manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline (requests and responses).
            The fetch method has one mandatory argument- the URL of the resource
            to be fetched. This method returns a Promise that can be used to
            retrieve the response of the request. EX::
            fetch('path-to-the-resource-to-be-fetched') .then((response) ={
              ">"
            }{" "}
            {"{"}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            // Code for handling the response <br />
            {"}"}) <br />
            .catch((error) ={">"} {"{"} <br />
            // Code for handling the error <br />
            {"}"});

            Which one is library or framework?
          </h4>
          <p>
            React is an open source JavaScript framework, that isn't actually a
            framework. But it is currently the most commonly used front-end
            development technology in the world. React, originally developed by
            and still maintained by Facebook and supported by an active open
            source community, is in fact a JS 'library'. React Native is a
            JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile
            applications for iOS and Android. It's based on React, Facebook's
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of
            targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.

            Why is react a library and react-native a framework?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Reactjs, eventually, is a JavaScript library, which enables the
            programmer to create an engaging and high performing UI Layer while
            React Native is an entire framework for building cross-platform
            apps, be it web, iOS or Android.

          <h2>
            use:React has a built-in hook called useMemo that allows you to
            memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on
            every render. You simple pass in a function and an array of inputs
            and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the
            inputs has changed.
